Our main intuition in selecting good parameters for wavelet transform often comes down to experience and prior information we have, such as interested frequency [&hellip;]</p>\n","categories":[{"name":"Article"}],"slug":"hello-world-2","date":"2019-03-25T06:58:49.000Z","acf":{"facebook":"","twitter":"","readingDuration":"5 min"}}}],"pathPrefix":"articles","first":false,"last":true,"index":2,"pageCount":2,"additionalContext":""}}
